# Python OOP mini-systems

A collection of milestone projects completed during my transition from procedural programming to object-oriented design in Python.  
These projects demonstrate key software engineering foundations — including control flow, data structures, class composition, inheritance, and state management — applied across small, self-contained systems.

---

## Project Structure
Each notebook contains a self-contained project, supporting modules, and test data when applicable.


---

## Milestone Overview

### **01. Tic-Tac-Toe (Two-player CLI)**
**Focus:** Function decomposition & interaction  
Implemented a terminal-based two-player game with board rendering, input validation, win/draw detection, and replay loop.

**Skills:** procedural programming, modular function design, control flow, input handling.

---

### **02. Blackjack (CLI)**
**Focus:** OOP with class composition  
Built a text-based Blackjack game using classes (`Card`, `Deck`, `Hand`, `Chips`), implementing a betting system, hit/stand logic, and Ace value adjustment.

**Skills:** object-oriented programming (OOP) design, encapsulation, method design, state management.

---

## 03. Applied Python Systems

### **3a. Credit Card Validator**
Implemented the **Luhn algorithm** for checksum validation and rule-based card classification (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) via number prefixes.

**Skills:** algorithm design, rule-based branching, defensive programming, string and regex operations.

---

### **3b. Bank Account Manager**
Modelled a basic banking system with inheritance and polymorphism.  
Created a parent `Account` class and multiple subclasses (`CheckingAccount`, `SavingsAccount`, `BusinessAccount`), orchestrated by a `Bank` class managing deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

**Skills:** OOP inheritance, class hierarchies, polymorphism, CLI workflow.

---

### **3c. Product Inventory System**
Developed an inventory tracker linking `Inventory` and `Product` classes for CRUD operations (add/remove/update/search), low-stock checks, and quantity adjustments.

**Skills:** OOP, data structures (lists, dictionaries), CRUD patterns, search/update logic.

---

### **3d. Library Lending System**
Constructed a lending management system using inheritance and polymorphism.  
`Item` serves as a parent class for `Book`, `Journal`, and `DVD`, while `Member` and `Loan` manage lending, returns, and due-date tracking.

**Skills:** OOP inheritance, encapsulation, state management, domain modelling.

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Transitioned from procedural to object-oriented programming.
- Designed class-based systems with composition, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Implemented algorithms and CRUD workflows using core Python data structures.
- Strengthened debugging, input validation, and modular design practices.
- Developed reusable, testable, and well-documented code structures.

---

## Technologies & Tools
- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Core Libraries:** `datetime`, `re`, `sys`, `os`  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
