# Python OOP Mini-Systems

A set of compact Python systems demonstrating practical object-oriented design.  
Each project models a real process using classes, composition, inheritance, and structured state management, with an emphasis on clarity and modularity.

---

## Project Structure

Each project is implemented as an independent Jupyter Notebook, with supporting modules and test data included when relevant.

---

## Milestone Overview

### 01. Tic-Tac-Toe (Two-Player CLI)
A terminal-based two-player game with board rendering, input validation, win/draw detection, and a replay loop.

**Skills:** procedural programming, modular function design, control flow, input handling.

---

### 02. Blackjack (CLI)
Text-based Blackjack system built with classes (`Card`, `Deck`, `Hand`, `Chips`), including betting, hit/stand logic, and Ace value handling.

**Skills:** class composition, encapsulation, method structure, state management.

---

## 03. Applied Python Systems

### 3a. Credit Card Validator
Implementation of the **Luhn algorithm** for checksum validation and card type classification using prefix rules.

**Skills:** algorithm design, branching logic, defensive programming, string and regex handling.

---

### 3b. Bank Account Manager
A simplified banking system using inheritance and polymorphism.  
A base `Account` class is extended by `CheckingAccount`, `SavingsAccount`, and `BusinessAccount`, coordinated by a `Bank` class handling transactions.

**Skills:** inheritance, class hierarchies, polymorphism, CLI workflow.

---

### 3c. Product Inventory System
An inventory tracker connecting `Inventory` and `Product` classes for CRUD operations, low-stock checks, and quantity updates.

**Skills:** OOP design, list/dict structures, CRUD patterns, search/update logic.

---

### 3d. Library Lending System
A lending management system using an `Item` parent class for `Book`, `Journal`, and `DVD`; with `Member` and `Loan` classes managing lending, returns, and due-dates.

**Skills:** inheritance, encapsulation, state management, domain modelling.

---

## Learning Outcomes

- Application of OOP principles: composition, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism  
- Structured modelling of real processes using class hierarchies  
- Implementation of algorithms and CRUD workflows with core Python data structures  
- Strengthened debugging, validation, and modular design techniques  
- Creation of reusable, well-documented code components  

---

## Technologies & Tools

- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Core Libraries:** `datetime`, `re`, `sys`, `os`  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
